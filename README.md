### Project 1: Bellabeat Case Study - How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play it Smart?

- **Description:** This project was a data analytics case study completed as part of the capstone course for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The case study was completed to demonstrate the professional data analysis skills I have developed through completing the certification. In the project, I examined the welness technology company Bellabeat, who makes smart health and fitness tracker devices designed for women. In the analysis, I examined publicly available smart device usage data to learn new insights and trends regarding how people are using non-Bellabeat smart devices. I then included these discovered insights into a report which detailed the analytical process used as well as exact reccomendations for stakeholders to take action on.
